# Race Relations in Singapore
[Race Relations in Singapore](racerelations.better.sg) is a public spreadsheet created by [Adila](https://www.instagram.com/adila_s/?hl=en) that is a compilation of educational resources on Singapore's race relations. It comprises of everything from books to articles to podcasts to videos, and is still being updated. 


It was then translated into a website by myself to make the viewing experience more accessible for its growing audience. 


Built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api). Hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).


Special thanks to [better.sg](better.sg) for reaching out to us and providing us with a sick URL. Cheers!
