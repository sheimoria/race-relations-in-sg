## About
Race Relations in Singapore is a public spreadsheet created by [Adila](https://www.instagram.com/adila_s/?hl=en) that compiles educational resources on Singapore's race relations from all over the Internet. It comprises of everything from articles to podcasts to videos, and is still being updated. 


It was then translated into a website by me to make the viewing experience more accessible for its growing audience. 


Built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api)
