                Hello there,
                <br>
                <br>
                This document is intended to serve as a resource bank for us to deepen our knowledge about race relations in Singapore. It was inspired by the compilation of <a class="text-info" href="">Anti-Racism Resources document</a> compiled by <a class="text-info" href="">Sarah Sophie Flicker</a> and <a class="text-info" href="">Alyssa Klein</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The resources have been separated into different categories namely, articles, books, social media accounts, videos, websites and others. Some resources may not be about race entirely but are still important in highlighting how race can intersect with other identities (nationality, religion, gender etc.) to perpetuate double and/or triple discrimination in Singapore.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the course of my research, I have also come across useful scholarly articles and books that have been compiled and shared beforehand by <a class="text-info" href="">Academia SG</a> and <a class="text-info" href="">@ikansumbat</a>, and have included them in this list for ease of reference.
                <br>
                <br>
                Disclaimer: While I do work in this field, I am compiling this resource bank on my own accord. I have always been passionate about issues of inequality in Singapore and as a minority, issues surrounding race in Singapore are close to my heart. It is important for all of us to educate ourselves and to continue establishing (safe) spaces to have conversations about the realities of race relations in Singapore.
                <br>
